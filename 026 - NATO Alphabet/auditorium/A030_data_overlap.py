# Hint:
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword.
