API: Application Programming Interface:
Is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects
that programmers can use to create software or interact
with an external system.

Essentially the API is an interface:
Your Program  --> API      --> External System
              --> Request  -->
              <-- Response <--

The API is like a MENU of a restaurant, it tells you
what's on there so you can make a request to the kitchen

API endpoint (URL): 
You can imagine the endpoint as the location of the data

API request:
Is like going to the bank and asking the bank teller how much 
money is on the account or a very simple question like:
What are your opening hours?



ISS API example:

Response codes:

What are the response codes we can get from an API?

404 - The thing you are looking for doesn't exist.

1XX - Hold on, something's happening. This is not final.
2XX - Here you go, everything was successful.
3XX - You don't have permission to get this thing, go away.
4XX - You screwed up.
5XX - I screwed up. (Server is down, website is down, etc)

API's can receive parameters and will give you different output
based on those parameters
